# Taco-Form

The Odin Project Forms Project.

I will be creating a user friendly taco enthusiast form with client side validation using HTML and CSS. The required inputs will be accessible for those who use screen readers.

Demonstrate the use of pseudo selectors, basic client side input validation, and styled for each major browser.

Thank you for taking the time to view my work. I am on a journey to become a front end web developer.
